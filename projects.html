	<h2>Mexico</h2> 
	<p>I have been to Mexico once and the things I liked most about it was the food and the resort.</p>

	<h2>Toronto, Canada</h2>
	<p>I've been to Toronto many times and my favorite things to do are go to Blue Jays games, Raptors games, and enjoy exploring the downtown parts. The only thing I don't like about it is that the traffic is usually horrible.</p>

	<h2>Las Vegas</h2>
	<p>I've only been to Las Vegas once and it is quite the experience. The things I enjoyed most was the food and the sportsbooks they have. I am not too much of a gambler so I did not go crazy and lose a ton of money like most people.</p>
